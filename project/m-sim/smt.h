   *
   * stores may execute when:
   *   1) register operands are ready
   *
   * stores are serviced by:
   *   1) depositing store value into the load/store queue
   *   2) writing store value to the store buffer (plus tag check) at commit
   *   3) writing store buffer entry to data cache when cache is free
   *
   * NOTE: the load/store queue can bypass a store value to a load in the same
   *   cycle the store executes (using a bypass network), thus stores complete
   *   in effective zero time after their effective address is known
